Accounts Reconcilor Library
===========================

This library should work with a series of bank transactions and do the following:

  * Enable users to assign an explaination to a transaction.
  * Make sensible predictions about the explainations for new Transactions, based on the previous explainations provided by the user.
  * Retrieve transactions by category or tag.
  * View the attachments
Explaination = {
  description: "Birthday present",
  categories: [gifts],
  tags: [unplanned, family, giving],
  attachments: ['receipt.pdf']
}

A story of two applications
---------------------------

Two applications I want to build need this common library at the core:

Team budget application:
  transaction explainations assign transactions to squads and spending types. Also has an 'expenses request' feature to log an expense, and the ability to map that expense as the explanation for a transaction:
    Expense < Explanation do
      spent_by = user id,
      evidence = self.attachment.
  
Personal budget application:

Finally want to nail finance tracking and budget setting by creating a really simple interface. 

list categories: set spending amount for month per category, explain transactions, review actual vs budget.


Import library
--------------

Ability to import CSVs, PDFs etc and turn them into an array of transactions
